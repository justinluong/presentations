# Vim Presentation

## What is Vim?

## Why use Vim?

### Main Benefits
1. Powerful way to navigate and edit code
2. Allows you to edit files in keyboard only environments such as when you SSH into a VM

### Why not use the shortcuts built into your editor?

Why Vim over other shortcuts?
1. It's ubiquotious, most machines already have Vim installed and most editors have a Vim extension
2. Unlikely to go away anytime soon (mature & popular), this skill has a high half-life
